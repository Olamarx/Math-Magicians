          <h2>Welcome to the Magician&#39;s Page</h2>

          <p>
            If you are asking about how someone feels
            about you, and you draw the  Magician, that means
            that this person feels that you are very special, and that you might be
            “the One.” They feel that they can talk to you about
            anything and everything, and that you stimulate and satisfy them on all
            levels: physically (pentacles/earth), emotionally
            (cups/water), spiritually (wands/fire), and
            intellectually (swords/air). They feel that
            you understand them at a very deep level.
            Their feelings for you go beyond just
            potential, because they see your
            relationship manifesting in reality.
            This is real, and this is amazing!
            <br />
            The Magician as feelings means that they
            feel charmed and inspired by you.
            You make them feel magical. They feel excited
            and happy to be alive. They feel creative and in
            touch with their “why” and their intention,
            extending to the depths of their soul. You
            make them feel confident in themselves and in
            their relationship with you. They have a vision
            for where you are in their life, and a
            vision for where you both can go together.
            <br />
            For singles and those embarking on new
            relationships, the Magician can be a sign that
            someone has fallen head over heels for you and
            is eager to take your relationship to the next
            level. Unlike the Fool, the Magician’s feelings
            go beyond butterflies and initial infatuation.
            It’s so easy for the two of you to communicate.
            They are excited to work together with you to
            create a mutually satisfying relationship,
            founded on a shared vision.
            <br />
            For existing relationships, the Magician means
            that they truly feel that you are their
            partner in life and soulmate. You’ve
            experienced so much together and you have
            been there for each other, through
            thick and thin. You’ve been there in the
            trenches for each other. You were there
            for them when they had nothing. You created
            this life together, and it’s a sight to be seen.
            They admire you and how you’ve worked together
            to create a beautiful and abundant relationship.
            They feel excited to enjoy the fruits of your labor.
            <br />
            If you are asking about an old flame or an ex’s feelings
            about you, the Magician can symbolize that their old
            feelings for you have been reignited. They remember
            what you shared and what you had together, and how
            special your relationship was. They may feel
            that the grass is not greener on the other side.
            They feel an urge to return to you. It’s
            possible that they will reach out soon. If they
            do, they will likely make their intentions
            very clear, because the Magician is all
            about manifestation.
            <br />
            In the context of whether or not a relationship
            is headed for commitment, engagement, or marriage,
            the Magician as feelings says that they are looking
            to take your relationship to the next level. As a
            card of manifestation, it is all about having a vision and
            turning dreams into reality. Will they propose?
            The Magician suggests yes, because they see a future
            with you and want to do what it takes to make it happen.
